# RabbitMqTech

##Used technologies:
RabbitMQ, Automapper, xUnit (for unit and integration tests), EFCore, MediatR (basicly pattern was used only for User controller, just had a desire to try it here. By the way IPipelineBehavior also was used), Quartz, SignalR, Swagger and Authentication via JWT, Angular, ngx-toastr, RxJS, Docker. Also here you can find workflows which are running tests for backend and frontend, also building and pushing docker image to ghcr.io
